# Project Name - Hotel Booking Analysis

In this project we are working in Hotel Booking Analysis dataset and review the features of this dataset. Dataset contains 32 columns and 119390 rows. The workflow of this project is divided into three steps.

Step 1: Data collection. In this step we load our data and check the basic features in our dataset. Basic description of the features is defined below in which detail of each column is given. In this step we will also analyse which feature is categorical and which feature is numerical.

Step 2: Data cleaning and Data wrangling. In this step we will deal with missing and duplicate values. After that we tranform our data in most suitable format.

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is an analysis approach that identifies general patterns in the data. We will also use visualisation to find insights from the data
